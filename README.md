# Python Basic Calculator

This repository contains a simple Python-based calculator script designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator runs in a terminal or command-line interface and prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an operation. The result is then displayed accordingly. It also includes error handling for division by zero. This project is ideal for beginners learning Python, user input handling, and control structures. It demonstrates how to use functions for better code structure and clarity.
